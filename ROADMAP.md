# Project Roadmap

## Current Status

Our main web application is built on Rails 7. The primary focus is to ensure the backend essential part is functioning correctly.

## Upcoming Milestones

### Backend Enhancement

Our first milestone is to enhance the backend of our Rails 7 application. We aim to ensure that all essential features are working as expected.

### UI/UX and PWA Conversion

Once the backend is stable, we will focus on improving the user interface and user experience. The ultimate goal is to convert the web application into a Progressive Web App (PWA).

### Elixir Service

In parallel to the UI/UX improvements, we will be working on an Elixir service. This service is a private project and will be integrated with the main app once it's functional.

## Future Plans

The Elixir service is in its early stages. It is a project aimed at fine-tuning an AI to be concise and precise about budget management and financial investment.
